ServiceExamples
===============

You can create local and remote Services and bind/unbind to them. The Service itself contains a callback that sends the current time to the activity via a Callback

This is a repository, in which you can find a hopefully well commented
I build this with the Android Studio Version 0.8.6. 
For the UI there's Butterknife as Helper to keep the Code clean.

This is not a library you should use for your projects. It's more a tutorial or a reference to check, if you are running into problems or you've never done that before.

This bould be useful for you if you want to learn:
 * how to create services
 * how to create callbacks
 * see the difference between a local and a remote service
  
 Hope I could help someone with that.
